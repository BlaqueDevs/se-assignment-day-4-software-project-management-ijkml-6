## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

- Ensures the solution is focused and relevant.
- Helps prioritize features and avoid unnecessary work.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

- "A tool that makes X easier by solving Y in a simple, user-friendly way."

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

- Unique features.
- Superior performance.
- Better user experience.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
